PasswordGenerator is created in C# using Windows Forms .NET 8.0 in Visual Studio 2022. The executable can be found in bin\Debug.
The PasswordGenerator app allows users to deselect unwanted characters, or only allow numeric characters. The app also has an
entropy calculator which rates the strength of the password.
